# Welcome to my portfolio's repository

Feel free to explore and see how it all works, I'd recommend starting in src/components/Landing.js which is where you are right now!  

## Technologies

This was built using React JS, SCSS and a small collection of helpful open source packages, full list [here](https://github.com/fanninggg/portfolio/blob/master/package.json)

The data is provided by a Ruby on Rails API, which can be found [here](https://github.com/fanninggg/rails-portfolio-api)

## About

A lot of the work I have done over the years has been for clients whose code bases I am not at liberty to share, or on live commercial projects. As such, I thought this would be a nice way to show you some code that *I am* allowed to share. If you'd like to know more about this project or about me, feel free to get in contact with me: fanninggg@gmail.com

If you are viewing this page on github directly, the portfolio itself can be found here [https://www.benfanning.dev/](https://www.benfanning.dev/).
